# About this site

## Purpose

This tool is a benchmarking application created to assist the on-chain AI inference community in understanding the performance and trade-offs of various proving systems. Given the increasing number of systems and the complexity of setting up individual benchmarks, this tool aims to provide a practical comparison. We have strived to maintain similar conditions across all benchmarks to ensure a fair comparison. The goal is to help developers decide which proving system is most suitable for their needs.

## Comparability

Though the industry is still in its infancy, these frameworks all have the same goal - to prove AI inferences on-chain. There are many considerations to look at when choosing between frameworks, and this tool aims to provide the relevant information developers need to choose the right framework for their use case.

## Benchmarking methodology

For these initial stats, we're using our own custom python based benchmarking system. We have laid out the groundwork for rust benchmarks, and plan to migrate to these when they are ready.

The rust benchmarking system is based on Polylang's zk benchmarking tool called [benchy](https://crates.io/crates/benchy).

## Future Plans

Community support to add more systems, benchmarks and make improvements to the benchmarking tool is welcome. We plan to improve upon our methods of benchmarking and the site itself to deliver a better experience for developers who need help choosing the best framework for their use case.

## Additional benchmarks

Since the space is constantly evolving, new benchmarks and new proving systems will need to be added. We are open to suggestions and contributions from the community. If you would like to add a new benchmark or a new proving system, please [submit a PR](https://github.com/inference-labs-inc/chainBench).

## Kudos

We would like to thank Polylang for creating [zkBench](https://zkBench.dev) and [benchy](https://crates.io/crates/benchy), which have served as great starting points for this site.
