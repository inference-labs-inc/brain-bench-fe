# About this site

## Purpose

This site is a benchmarking and comparison tool demonstrating features and performance of several zk-ml proving systems available for use today. The goal is to provide a comprehensive comparison of the various systems available, and to help developers choose the best system for their use case.

## Comparability

Though the industry is still in its infancy, these frameworks all have the same goal - to prove AI inferences on-chain. There are many considerations to look at when choosing between frameworks, and this tool aims to provide the relevant information developers need to choose the right framework for their use case. Currently, the benchmark comparisons aren't fully apples to apples due to cairo and risc0 running on VMs, while EZKL and ZKML are running on native hardware.

## Benchmarking methodology

This tool is based on EZKL's zkml-benchmarking suite. We have added a few additional metrics into the benchmarks for the purposes of providing more comparable data to viewers of this site.

## Future plans

We plan to include more comparable fields in the future and add more frameworks as they're released.
